In this project, we investigate the performances of four deep learning based and one conventional reconstruction techniques which are U-Net based deep learning,
generative adversarial networks with U-Net based deep learning, robust artificial neural networks for k-space interpolation (RAKI) reconstruction, 
artificial neural networks [8] and generalized auto calibrating partially parallel acquisitions (GRAPPA) MRI reconstruction.
